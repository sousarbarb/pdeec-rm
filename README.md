# GoBowlingApp: Simulated Bowling Game in SimTwo using a Lazarus-based Application

This repository contains the work developed in the course Robotic Manipulators of the doctoral program in Electrical and Computers Engineering (ECE) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

A simulated bowling game was developed with the SimTwo simulator and an application developed in Lazarus. The bowling lane, pins and ball are modeled accordingly to the official rules elaborated by the United States Bowling Congress. For throwing the ball, it is used an anthropomorphic robot manipulator mounted on a x-axis. Further improvements can be made to stabilise the simulation environment, improve the control scheme, and also taking advantage of the kinematic redundancy of the 7 DoF robot manipulator.

## Usage

1. Open the application GoBowlingApp developed in Lazarus ([src/GoBowlingApp/GoBowlingApp.exe](src/GoBowlingApp/GoBowlingApp.exe))
2. Open SimTwo simulator ([src/SimTwo64/SimTwo2020.exe](src/SimTwo64/SimTwo2020.exe))
3. Play the bowling game
   - Select Ball mode in the application and interact in the Simulation tab
   - Close and open SimTwo to reset the bowling pins if necessary
